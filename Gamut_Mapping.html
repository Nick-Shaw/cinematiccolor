Gamut Mapping</A>
</H3>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Tone mapping is concerned with dynamic range, which can affect color, as the previous example showed. Gamut mapping adjusts colors between different color gamuts. Understanding how to read files without a display of the correct gamut is a useful skill.

This is a crop from the original P3 gamut source. It will only look as intended on a P3 calibrated display. On a Rec. 709 or sRGB display the image will appear less saturated than it should, but the color detail is visible.

Here is the same crop, converted to Rec. 709 with clipping in the red channel evident on the cheek, shirt and background. The saturation level is now correct and the transfer function and white point remain the same but the clipping artifacts are objectionable and an unnecessary compromise since there is no clipping in the P3 source. The clipped colors are valid in the P3 gamut, but out of the Rec. 709 gamut.

This version shows a gamut warning. The zebra pattern identifies all areas of the P3 source that are outside of the 709 gamut and helps to direct the artist to where artifacts will occur if no further action is taken.

This version shows the Rec. 709 gamut master after gamut mapping the colors that were outside of the Rec. 709 gamut to appropriate colors inside the Rec. 709 gamut to avoid clipping in the red channel. The difference is subtle on the printed page but significantly better than the clipped approach. Most colors that were already visible in the Rec. 709 gamut remain unchanged, only the out of gamut colors and those with the highest saturation are different. The result has minimal impact on artistic intent, retains the highly saturated look and yet avoids a loss of detail in the 709 version.

This butterfly split of the clipped image on the left and the mapped image on the right shows the improvement in the cheek and the hem of the shirt. Had the original master been the Rec. 709 version on the right, the P3 version would look identical to the Rec. 709 version when seen on a P3 display, though it would still look less saturated when seen incorrectly on a Rec. 709 display. No gamut mapping would be required. However, the opportunity to push the saturated look that is clearly intended, to the limits of P3 would be lost.
