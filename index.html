        <h3>Welcome to Cinematic Color.</h3>

<p>This is the companion website to the <a href="http://s2012.siggraph.org/attendees/sessions/cinematic-color-your-monitor-big-screen">2012 Siggraph Course</a>.</p>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>This class presents an introduction to the color pipelines behind modern feature-film visual-effects and animation.</p>
<p>Color impacts many areas of the computer graphics pipeline. From texture painting to lighting, rendering to compositing, and from image display to the theater, handling color is a tricky problem. Tired of getting your images right on the monitor, only to have them fall apart later on? The goal of this course is to familiarize attendees with th e best practices used in modern visual effects and animation color pipelines, and how to adapt these concepts for home use.</p>
<p>The course begins with an introduction to color processing, and its relationship to image fidelity, color reproducibility, and physical realism. We will discuss common misconceptions about linearity, gamma, and working with high-dynamic range (HDR) color spaces. Pipeline examples from recent films by Sony Pictures Imageworks will be included, with a discussion of what color transforms were utilized, and why these approaches were taken. Finally, we will present a brief introduction to the Academy’s recent efforts on color standardization in computer graphics (ACES), and how the audience can experiment with all of these concepts for free using open-source software (OpenColorIO).</p>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
