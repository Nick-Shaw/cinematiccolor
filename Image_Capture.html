Image Capture</A>

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Image formation imposes that a signal was captured and processed in the first place.
In section 2.3.2, spectroradiometers, spectrophotometers, and tristimulus colorimeters are presented as the instruments used to perform color stimuli measurements in Colorimetry.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">While most of the time they are used to perform unrelated color measurements for a single sample, they share similar principles and components with cameras and telescopes:
An entrance slit akin to the tiny aperture of pinhole cameras
Collimating lenses or mirrors akin to telescope mirrors or camera lenses beaming and guiding the light toward the measuring portion of the instrument.
A prism or diffraction grating that spreads the light beam so that individual components can be measured at a discrete interval.
A Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) or Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) similar to those of movie or astrophotography cameras.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">CMOS sensors tend to be cheaper to produce, have less power consumption, e.g. 100 times less, but usually exhibit more noise than CCD sensors. CMOS sensors are typically found in consumer and motion pictures cameras while CCD sensors are usually used in astrophotography and scientific applications requiring the lowest noise profile possible. 
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Both sensor types register photons hits, which upon conversion to electrons are stored into charge packets that are then read out.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">A successful and accurate color imaging system must have color reproduction characteristics following the HVS, and thus must be trichromatic. Image capture devices such as consumer and movie cameras attempt to be colorimetric by satisfying the Maxwell-Ives criterion which states that their spectral responses, i.e. their sensitivities, must be a linear combination of the CMFs to reduce metameric failures.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Nikon 5100 sensitivities compared to HVS cone fundamentals for 2 degrees.
In practice, most consumer and motion pictures cameras are not colorimetric, and compromises are made to increase performance such as offsetting the red response of the sensor to longer wavelengths to reduce the noise arising from a peak centered like those of the L cones.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Traditionally, photographs and movies were captured using photographic film. However, with the digital transition and advent of digital capture in the 2000s, this practice is nowadays becoming rarer thus it will not be described in favor of electronic color imaging systems.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">While some high-end camera systems use an expensive set of three dichroic filters, three CCD sensors and, a beam-splitter prism, the vast majority of consumer and motion pictures cameras adopt a Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) with a single sensor. The Bayer CFA is an arrangement of colored filters over the sensor photosites. The exact bandpass characteristics of the filters vary between cameras, but they are designed to transmit red, green and blue light. Because the HVS sensitivity peaks at 555nm, there are twice as many green filtered photosites as there are red or blue. This Bayer CFA was invented by Bryce Bayer at Eastman Kodak and patented in 1976. It empowered the production of much cheaper and compact image capturing systems at the price of reduced image quality due to the loss in spatial resolution and increased noise.
