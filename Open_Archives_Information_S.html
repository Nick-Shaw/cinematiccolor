Open Archives Information System (OAIS)</A>
</H2>

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">In the 1970’s NASA recorded vast amounts of data from its space program and had an urgent need to develop a standard for practical long-term preservation of digital files. The resulting OAIS has since been the foundation for the digital archives of governments, libraries and content archives, large and small, around the world. The latest version is the Magenta Book of 2012 which describes the recommended practice for an organization of people and systems to protect and make available digital information. The word “Open” in the title refers to transparency of the system rather than meaning that access to the information should be unrestricted. It has been ratified as ISO 14721:2012.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The model uses the following terms for its components:
Producers create content and are production and post-production for purposes of this paper
Archive is the physical data storage of completed material, not work in progress.
Managers are those responsible for the policies that govern the Archive
Consumers are those that have legitimate access to the Archive content, not the end user.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">OAIS Archive Model
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">It defines an Information Object as the product of a Data Object plus its Representation Information.
Data Object is a digital file, for example, an image file.
Representation Information is everything needed to understand that file. In the example of an image file that must include the file format, how to read that format and also everything required to display the file correctly.
Information Object is content that is preserved in the archive. Without the representation information, the data is at risk of being lost since there is an unreasonable assumption that the Knowledge Base for reading and understanding the information will always be universally known. The recommended practice likens this to a simple English text, without a suitable dictionary and grammar explanation.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">OAIS Information Object
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The simple information object is moved in and out of the archive and stored there as an Information Package, which consists of Content Information and Preservation Description Information (PDI). There needs to be some Packaging Information that keeps these two elements together and Descriptive Information that describes what the Information Package contains. The Descriptive Information could be as simple as a file name, or a more complicated list of delivery specifications.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Information Package
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The PDI clearly identifies the Content Information and the model goes on to identify five types of information that should be recorded.
	Provenance describes the source, history, and ownership of the material
	Context describes any relationships with other content, for example, an episode in a series. It might contain other relationships such as the originating studio, producer or director.
	Reference information should include any unique identifiers that are or could be used to recognize the content in one or more systems
	Fixity is protection from undocumented alteration and could be in the form of a checksum or other method of ensuring that the information is as described
	Access Rights contains the terms of access, ownership, licensing, and permission for preservation operations as well as specifications for rights enforcement and access control.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System Magenta Book goes into a lot more detail on setting up, managing and using an archive, which is beyond the scope of this paper. This basic introduction to data management is however relevant at all stages of data production, manipulation and delivery and is worth bearing in mind when sharing digital files between software, departments or organizations.
