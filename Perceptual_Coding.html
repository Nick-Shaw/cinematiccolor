<BIG CLASS="LARGE">As Poynton (1998) explains, a color imaging system is perceptually uniform if a small perturbation of a component value is approximately equally perceptible across the range of that value.
</BIG>

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Most electronic color imaging systems account for the non-linearity of the HVS and its logarithmic perceptual response to brightness when encoding RGB scene relative luminance values (linear-light values) into R’G’B’ perceptually uniform values using an OETF. The encoding process makes the reduction of bandwidth and the number of bits required per pixel possible by optimizing digital codes allocation as described in the next section.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Old cathode ray tube (CRTs) displays’ electron gun characteristics imposed an EOTF that is approximately the inverse of the HVS perception of brightness. The combination of HVS perceptual response to brightness with the CRT power function produces code values displayed in a perceptually uniform way. Non-linear coding was well understood by the engineers who designed the NTSC television system and was necessary to achieve good visual performance. Modern Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) display devices, e.g. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), plasma, and Digital Light Processing (DLP), replicate this behavior by imposing a 2.2, 2.4 or 2.6 power function through signal processing circuitry. Their response to the input signal is often reasonably modeled using a gain-offset-gamma (GOG) approximation.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">L = (gain × V + offset)ɣ
where L is the normalized luminance emitted from the display, V is the normalized input device code value, and γ is the Gamma exponent and is discussed in details in section 2.5.5.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">As described in section 2.2.6, an increment in Luminance is judged relative to the previous amount. The difference between a Luminance value L and a Luminance value L + ΔL is noticeable for ΔL &gt;&nbsp;0.01L. In other words, the just-noticeable-difference (JND) between two Luminance values is about 1
The 1.01 (101 / 100) ratio is known as the Weber contrast or Weber fraction. On a linear-light values scale from code 0 to code 255, code 100 is the location where the Weber contrast reaches 1An ideal non-linear transfer function allocates code values to minimize the just-noticeable difference. Advanced approaches, e.g. DICOM GSDF and PQ, account for the spatial frequency behavior of the HVS and leverage Barten (2003) Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) to model almost optimal functions.

</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The contrast ratio is the ratio between the lowest luminance (reference black) and the highest luminance (reference white) that an electronic color imaging system is capable of producing. The artifact devoid contrast ratio is the ratio between the lowest luminance value that can be reproduced without artifacts (code 100 on a linear system) and the peak luminance of the system.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">For 8 bit linear-light code values, the artifact devoid contrast ratio is only 2.55:1 (255 / 100). The "code 100" problem as Poynton (2003) terms it, can be addressed by using 12 bit coding (4095 code values) yielding an artifact devoid contrast ratio of 40.95:1, however, most of those codes cannot be visually discriminated.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">On the other hand, using a logarithmic or power based perceptual coding, the required number of code values can be dramatically reduced, for example maintaining a 1.01 Weber contrast over scene relative luminance range of [0.01, 100] (contrast ratio of 100:1), requires approximately 462 codes (≈ 9 bits).
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Perceptual coding is not required when using 16 bit integer (artifacts free contrast ratio of 655.35:1) or half float-representations (Weber contrast of 0.1
