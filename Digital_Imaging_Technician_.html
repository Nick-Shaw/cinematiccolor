<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">It is the Digital Imaging Technicianâ€™s (DIT) responsibility to liaise between set and post-production. They need to communicate with those who will be responsible for dealing with the image further down the line, as well as with the cinematographer, to ensure they have an understanding of the intended color pipeline and required deliverables. The role originated as the person responsible for understanding the controls in video cameras, as productions moved to HD video from film acquisition so that the cinematographer could focus on lighting and exposing as they had done in the past.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Historically live grades were often applied to an output-referred signal from the camera, with a base viewing transform already baked in. The same grade applied before or after a display transform will give a very different result. This limits the look modifications that the DIT can apply to crude approximations of the intended look, useful only for visual reference rather than as reusable metadata. This is comparable to the way cinematographers have in the past experimented with looks in Photoshop. Now tools are becoming available which allow the cinematographer to craft a look with scene-referred images, using the same tools as will be used by the DIT on set, and later in the DI. The DIT should work with the cinematographer to ensure that this process is understood, and works smoothly.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">If a live grading system is used, the DIT is responsible for creating primary grades to improve consistency from shot to shot. They will often maintain a library of stills from previous setups or locations, to aid the cinematographer in matching the lighting, and to even out the differences still further using simple color corrections. It is important if grades created on set are to be successfully passed on and used later, that the working space in which the color operations are applied, and the view transform used, is agreed beforehand and communicated clearly so that the look can be replicated accurately. Even within the standardized ACES pipeline, there is the option to grade in ACEScc or ACEScct. The result of using either of these is identical in the mid-tones and highlights of the image, but the look of the shadows will be different.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Key Points
A DIT must communicate with the camera department and post, and liaise between the two
For live grading to be truly useful it must use the same color management approach as will be used further down the line
