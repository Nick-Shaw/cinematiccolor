       DI Grading Workflows

     <p>
      There are as many workflows for DI grading as there are for VFX. Some start as early as pre-production, some involve live grades during production and some do not assign the finishing colorist until quite late in the project. Collaboration between VFX and the Color department always pays dividends. If the grade begins after VFX, which is not unusual, then plates are likely to be delivered as camera files and need neutralizing. Without a clear direction of the final look, flexibility and latitude are even more critical. If a colorist is on board in time, look creation will have at least begun, and it is reasonable to expect neutralized plates from the Color department. The file format and viewing arrangements can vary according to time, budget and complexity, but scene-referred plates without the look applied are recommended. An ACES EXR file is the most reliable option.  While CDLs are good for providing a general direction for the Look, they are quite limited in scope. A 3D LUT can achieve more selective changes but is less useful in communicating alterations. It is possible to use a CDL and a LUT providing all parties can handle both. There are bespoke and proprietary tools which work well, are more precise and better for communicating change, but again only useful if all parts of the process are compatible. Even with good planning, seeing shots on a big calibrated screen in a controlled environment often reveals things for the first time and adjustments have to be made.  Highlights that distract from the action might need dulling, or an important part of the image might need enhancing to bring more attention to it. These changes might cause a ripple effect and other elements might then need matching back to the new tweaks. Color finishing is fluid and ultimately where all the pieces of a project come together.
     </p>
     <p>
      In animation, Look Management is usually settled at the start of production rather than at the end of post-production. The Look is much more likely to remain consistent up to and including the mastering stages of the DI grade. The DI Grade for animation is expected to focus on scene-to-scene continuity and smaller adjustments to highlight story points, less so on crafting the full look of a sequence or project.
     </p>
     <p>
      Look Management should determine the methods by which elements are monitored and quality checked. It is, of course, appropriate to use waveforms, vectorscopes, and histograms to measure scene-referred values, but it is often reassuring to also see something output-referred. Since different approaches for output-referred previews produce very different results, a common method is invaluable. The test image from the previous section Section 3.6.4.1 DI Grading Tools was also processed with different color management solutions to demonstrate the risk of mixed approaches.

This first example is the most obvious and in some ways the truest to capture. It uses a LUT supplied by the camera manufacturer to optimize chromaticity and prepare the image for the EOTF of a Rec. 709 display. The ramp shows that the LUT tone maps all possible values without clipping. The result is better chroma separation and saturation than the primary grade examples, but also a flatter image. In fact, this representation is probably the most accurate and would serve as a good starting point for grading. In the DI grade color trims can be applied before the LUT, which keeps the process truly scene-referred. However, it is also common practice in television grades to color grade after the LUT. Grades after the LUT are output-referred and, as discussed previously may limit the ability to recover highlight and shadow detail. Additionally they cannot be used with a different output transform to target other display formats.

      This is the result of the test image output from ACES after the correct ARRI Input Transform and the Rec. 709 Output Transform (OT). The result has more punch and slightly more saturation than the ARRI LUT. The S-curve tone map is steeper and shows a different response in the shadows near black. In an ACES project grading is always scene-referred because the OT is managed by project settings rather than as a grading node. This lack of ambiguity is one more reason that ACES is considered the simplest, most reliable form of color management by so many. A cinematographer using ACES to monitor on set can be certain that VFX and DI grading can display the images exactly as seen when shot.

      This image is the result of a simple color management system in which the source and working color space are set to LogC ALEXA Wide Gamut and the output is set as 2.4 gamma Rec. 709 and all grading is, therefore, scene-referred with minimal transforms. Since there is no tone mapping applied by the color management it was necessary to use a small Gain adjustment to bring the image out of clipping. This was done by taking the brightest pixels, the highlights on the flower, and bringing them down just out of clipping. The resulting image has the lowest contrast of all the tests and shows details even in the dark skin. The shadows on the pale skin are so light that the look is rather unnatural. The chroma separation and saturation are well defined and clean. This would make a decent starting point for a commercial or a Look for beauty products but because the color management alone does not tone map the entire dynamic range to that of the display. Exposures higher than the test image would appear clipped on a Rec. 709 display, even though the source data might not be clipped.
     </p>
     <p>
      The results from using different color tools or color management would cause for confusing conversations at best, but the greater concern is that finished scenes could be hard to match in the final conform because although they were created scene-referred, they were seen differently when they were created. Even the decision to apply tweaks to an otherwise standard color managed pipeline is a material fact that can considerably affect the time taken to achieve the DI grade and can in extreme cases necessitate a late change to the established look in order to hide discrepancies that were not seen in the creation stages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The above examples are not in any way exhaustive but clearly demonstrate the importance of Look Management. All of the examples are valid viewing transforms without an intentional creative Look applied. Any of these methods might be chosen as the starting point for crafting a look. Considerations in making that choice range from repeatability across multiple software, tone mapping capabilities to different display formats, and the ability to display good saturation and contrast, to the best aesthetic choice for managing the two skin tones in the same frame or preserving the hair color most accurately. These comparisons are kept simple for demonstration purposes. Real world examples could include considerably more effort to include an established Look on monitored previews.
