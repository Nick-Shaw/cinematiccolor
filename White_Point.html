White Point</A>
</H3>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The white point is defined by the CIE as the "achromatic reference stimulus in a chromaticity diagram that corresponds to the stimulus that produces an image area that has the perception of white". Any colors lying on the neutral axis line defined by the white point and its vertical projection toward the bottom of the RGB color space gamut, no matter their Luminance, are neutral to that RGB color space and thus achromatic.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Various RGB color spaces white points in the CIE 1960 UCS chromaticity diagram, note that the ACES white point is not precisely equal to CIE Illuminant D Series D60.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Typical white points are chosen as CIE Standard Illuminants. In 1953, the National Television System Committee (NTSC) published a standard for color television that used CIE Illuminant C. As noted in section 2.3.3, CIE Illuminant C was superseded by the CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65 and became the illuminant for the PAL and SECAM analog encoding systems for color television in the 1960s.
In the 1990s, desktop publishing CRT color monitors often adopted a white point close to CCT 9300 K which was deemed too high by the professional printing industry and graphic arts to suitably soft proof images. Printing workflows use CIE Illuminant D Series D50 (ISO 3664:1975) as it is somewhere between average daylight and incandescent light. CIE Illuminant D Series D50 is the illuminant adopted by the International Color Consortium (ICC) established in 1993 by eight imaging companies "for the purpose of creating, promoting and encouraging the standardization and evolution of an open, vendor-neutral, cross-platform color management architecture and components."
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Two white points were suggested as an alternative to the high CRT CCT: CIE Illuminant D Series D50 and CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65. Images displayed on monitors calibrated to CIE Illuminant D Series D50 were deemed dull and yellow in dim to average viewing conditions.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Following on from PAL and SECAM color television, and also as a consequence of the broad adoption of the sRGB IEC 61966-2-1:1999 standard, most modern computer display systems use CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Digital cinema as per the recommendation of the Digital Cinema Initiative (DCI) adopts the DCI-P3 white point based on a Xenon arc lamp spectral power distribution. ACES uses a white point close to CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D60: its lower CCT makes it more pleasing for dark viewing conditions typical of theatrical exhibition.
