     </h1>
     <p>
      Like color management, an archival procedure is relatively straightforward if it is included in planning from the start and incredibly traumatic if it has to be implemented after everything else. In a planned environment, archiving is little more than good housekeeping but the cost of introducing it retroactively can often be prohibitive.  One of the initial driving forces behind ACES was the lack of standards around color in archiving, and The Academy have recently published their Academy Digital Source Master draft specification, with the aim of standardizing the delivery archiving of ACES projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Project managers should consider how long the archive needs to last and to what purpose. The duration might be until the production is complete, delivered and fully signed off with the intention that even if a team has moved on to other things, all elements could be restored and work resumed should the need arise. This archive is separate from the day to day storage used by each department or facility, it is an untouched copy that is available if data is lost, corrupted or inaccessible. Alternatively, the archive could be part of a comprehensive asset management system intended to protect and future-proof valuable content. In theory, both scenarios face the same problems, but the solutions for risk management will differ in practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The challenges associated with archives can be simply stated as:
preservation of the data
preservation of the means to access the data
ease of access
low maintenance
     </p>
     <p>
      As a rule, the best-preserved data is the least easy to access. A painting locked in a bank vault has a better chance of surviving intact than a painting on the wall of a cafe. Similarly, the safest digital files are those that do not have direct access by a host of users. Access to the original digital data requires a physical reader device, a compatible operating system with suitable software and the necessary ancillary support to view or use the data correctly. Within the concerns of this paper, that includes a display calibrated to the correct color gamut or the means to create a correct transform to interpret the images as intended. There should also be a file, document or metadata that specifies the correct color gamut. The metadata for HDR10 and Dolby Vision requires this but other formats assume that a display gamut. The Thomson Viper camera is a good long-term example of the pitfalls for archives. It was one of the first cameras to capture data rather than video or film. Much of the media shot on it was stored on videotape and required proprietary LUTs to correctly remove the inherent green bias. In the decade since the camera was introduced, those VTRs have become scarce. To retrieve Viper data, the tapes would have to have been well stored and you would have to locate a VTR. Additionally, there are no Input Transforms to bring Viper Filmstream data into an ACES workflow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Preserving lossless copies of the digital data requires an ongoing managed schedule of refreshing, migrating and replicating the data.
     </p>
     <p>
      Refreshing is the transfer of data between two types of the same storage medium to protect against corruption or drive failure. This requires at least three copies so that any time one becomes different to the others, it is replaced. Checksum hashes should be calculated from the original media, and stored alongside each copy, so that its integrity can be subsequently verified. Even the loss of one bit can render an entire file unusable and there is a condition known as bit-rot that is statistically relevant to larger libraries. When an archive reaches a certain size some bit-rot is certain, although where it occurs is not. However, the highest risk to digital data is at the time of access and is caused either by operator error, or accidental deletion. For this reason, most archives do not allow access to the source content, they only allow content to be copied out of the archive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Duplicating the data is called Replication and of course, the more copies that exist, the less an asset is vulnerable to being lost. In the days of film, every release print made was a form of replication that increased the chances of an asset surviving. Unfortunately, however, there is a conflict of interest when an asset has commercial value. A studio that derives its income from sales of its content does not want countless copies in the market and therefore needs to plan and fund replication of high-quality master copies. When DVD and Rec. 709 broadcast were the biggest markets, studios archived to HD. As SDR HD has become more omnipresent, studios are moving to HDR UHD mastering. A few are already storing scene-referred copies of the graded and ungraded DI Masters with metadata that manages versioning for sound, picture format, length, and localization. This impacts the production and post-production pipeline since deliverables that are immediately compatible with the archive are likely to be a contractual requirement and that could narrow the workflow options. Replication and refreshing should include geo-redundant sites to avoid total failure in the event of a fire or similar catastrophe.
     </p>
     <p>
      Short term archival needs might be covered by refreshing and replicating, but long-term preservation also requires planned migration. Migration is the transfer of data to newer technologies. That could be a new file format, an updated operating system or different storage media.  The move from analog to digital and the move from tape to file delivery are both examples of migration. The cost of migration for an archive can be very high, so it is good practice to future proof the assets as much as possible. Working scene-referred and keeping a scene-referred master saves very expensive re-mastering later and gives content a longer shelf life. However, migration of storage media, operating systems and file formats still apply. Often visual effects, editors and colorists save projects as part of the archive backup, but these have a relatively limited usefulness as software evolves and unless changes are requested projects are rarely migrated.
