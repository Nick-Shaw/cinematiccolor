<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The raw image data must be processed to be displayed. Multiple operations are performed in succession until the image is ready. However, there is not a single, and unique path to that end and two cameras or raw processing applications might take different ways for a similar result. A typical process may adopt those steps:
Linearization
Black Level Subtraction
White Level Scaling
Clipping
White Balancing
Demosaicing
Conversion to Working RGB Color Space
With raw image captured by a Bayer CFA camera already linearly encoded or whose data is already linearized, the thermal black encoding level must be subtracted. The black subtracted image data is then rescaled in range 0-1 with the scale factor being the inverse of the difference between the white level, i.e. the saturation encoding level, point after which the sensor behaves non-linearly, or camera circuitry introduces clipping, and the maximum black level for a given channel. The scaled image is clipped so that no values are outside range 0-1.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The clipped image is white balanced so that achromatic colors of the scene stay neutral once reproduced. The process is similar to the HVS chromatic adaptation ability. Viggiano and Henrietta (2004) compared the accuracy of various white balancing methods and found "that the illuminant-dependent characterization produced the best results, sharpened camera RGB and native camera RGB were next best, XYZ and Von Kries were often not far behind, and balancing in the -709 primaries was significantly worse."
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The Von Kries chromatic adaptation method is described because of its widespread usage in other contexts such as conversion between RGB color space with different white points. It involves converting the image to a LMS color space representing the cone fundamentals sensitivities and perform gain adjustments on each one of the Long, Medium and Short components as follows:
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Where L', M', S' are the white-balanced LMS cone values, Lw, Mw, Sw are the LMS cone values of a reference achromatic object in the scene, e.g. a perfect white diffuser, and L, M, S are the non white-balanced LMS cone values. The conversion from CIE XYZ tristimulus values to LMS color space is performed with a chromatic adaptation matrix such as Bradford or CAT02.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">CAT02 chromatic adaptation matrix.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Once white balanced, the image must then be demosaiced to produce RGB pixel values for all the photosites. Many different demosaicing algorithms exist to estimate the values for the two unrecorded channels at each photosite. Fast ones, such as bilinear interpolation, used in real-time applications or for previewing purposes and editorial. Algorithms such as Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD) from Hirakawa and Parks (2005) or Demosaicing With Directional Filtering and a posteriori Decision (DDFAPD) from Menon (2007) produce much higher quality results but are slower. In the context of digital imagery that will be heavily post-processed, it is often preferable to use a demosaicing algorithm producing softer results and thus less prone to edge artifacts and then add sharpening selectively as part of the finishing process.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Upon demosaicing, the resulting image must be mapped from its native color space, often referred to as Camera RGB, to the CIE XYZ color space or any relevant RGB color space. The transformation is usually performed using a 3x3 matrix applied to the linear Camera RGB values. This matrix is the result of the camera characterization process described in section 4.8. and is ordinarily given by the camera makers or third-party organizations such as Adobe Systems with their camera .dcp profiles or the A.M.P.A.S with some of their ACES Input Device Transforms (IDT).
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">At this stage, the image is almost ready to be displayed: It requires a Look Transform and Output Transform as described in sections 3.1.3 and 3.14 to be faithfully represented.
