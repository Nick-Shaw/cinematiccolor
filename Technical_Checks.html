Technical Checks</A>

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">It is not normally practical for the workstations used for animation, lighting, VFX and compositing to show an entirely accurate preview of the final deliverable, especially if the principal master is HDR. Furthermore, while artists typically craft imagery assuming a particular viewing exposure, it is possible that the imagery will be stylistically color graded in unexpected ways in the DI grade. Therefore, care must be taken to preserve a wide dynamic range in the scene-referred linear working space, avoiding output-referred cheats and checking the result on an SDR display by pushing and pulling the exposure prior to the SDR viewing transform. Indeed, many facilities run a barrage of tests, often referred to as Quality Check (QC), Technical Checks or The Gauntlet to ensure that all completed CG and composites are robust enough to stand up to the manipulations of DI grading and that there are no artifacts which are masked by an SDR output transform that might be revealed by an HDR output transform.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The inclusion of deliverables for HDR displays makes this even more critical, as artists’ workstations may be unable to show an HDR image at all, and even if they can, they are unlikely to accurately represent the final HDR deliverable. If HDR monitoring is not possible at the desktop, having just a single shared HDR monitor to perform technical checks during the course of work can help prevent surprises that would otherwise only be discovered late during HDR finishing.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">At a minimum, artists working in scene-referred linear, namely the lighter and compositor, should aspire to view their imagery at a range of exposures as part of their regular production workflow. This enables artists to have a true sense of the dynamic range in their imagery and to match computer-generated elements with similar precision. In compositing, it is also expedient to convert the imagery to the color space, quantization, and clamping that will be delivered to DI, to test how the imagery holds up to drastic color grades. Best practice is to simulate substantial exposure adjustments, as well as contrast and saturation boosts, to confirm that all portions of the imagery track in a consistent manner. This is particularly important to match across shots and sequences. It is easy to make individual shots that are self-consistent, yet fall apart when viewed side to side. Most critical is the inspection of shadow detail. “Stopping up” the final composites, shadows should have a consistent color and density both inter-shot and intra-shot. Flat black portions of the image should be avoided - lest they reappear in DI grading - and grain/noise must match between the live-action and the computer-generated imagery. Inspecting highlights, one should confirm that their intensity, color, sharpness, and flare appearance are similarly consistent. For visual effects shots that don’t modify the entire live-action plate, the portions of the image that should be unaffected by the visual effects elements should be compared against the original live-action plate. It is important to make sure that no unintended changes to black levels, color balance, grain, resolution, bit depth or lens distortion have crept into the process.
