3D LUTs</A>
</H2>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Three-dimensional lookup tables offer the obvious solution to the inherent limitation of single-dimensional LUTs, allowing tabular data indexed on three independent parameters. Whereas a 1D LUT requires only 4 elements to sample 4 locations in an input range, the corresponding 3D LUT requires 43 = 64 elements. Beware of this added dimensionality; 3D LUTs grow very quickly as a function of their linear sampling rate, as does the processing power required, particularly in real-time systems. As a direct implication of smaller LUT sizes, high-quality interpolation takes on a greater significance for 3D LUTs. The two most commonly used interpolation methods are tri-linear and tetrahedral.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Complex color operators can be expressed using 3D LUTs, as completely arbitrary input-output mappings are allowed. For this reason, 3D LUTs have long been embraced by color scientists and are one of the tools commonly used for gamut mapping. In fact, 3D LUTs are used within ICC profiles to model the complex device behaviors necessary for accurate color image reproduction.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The majority of color operators are expressible using 3D LUTs. Simple operators (such as gamma, brightness, and contrast) are trivial to encode. More complex transforms, such as hue and saturation modifications, are also possible. Most important, the color operations typical of professional color-grading systems are expressible (such as the independent warping of user-specified sections of the color gamut).
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios, not all color transforms are definable as direct input-output mappings. In the general case, 3D LUTs can express only those transforms that obey the following characteristics:
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">A pixel's computation must be independent of the spatial image position. Color operators that are influenced by neighboring values, such as Bayesian-matting in Chuang et al. (2001) or classical garbage masks in Brinkman (1999), are not expressible in lookup-table form.
The color transform must be reasonably continuous, as sparsely sampled data sets are ill-suited to represent discontinuous transformations. If smoothly interpolating over the sampled transform grid yields unacceptable results, lookup tables are not the appropriate acceleration technique.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Careful attention must be paid when crafting 3D LUTs due to a large number of degrees of freedom offered. It is all too easy to create a transform that yields pleasing results on some subset of source imagery, but then reveals discontinuities when applied to alternative imagery. Both directly visualizing the 3D lattice and running image gradients through the color processing allow such discontinuities to be discovered ahead of time.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The input color space must lie within a well-defined domain. An analytically defined brightness operator can generate valid results over the entire domain of real numbers. However, that same operator baked into a lookup table will be valid over only a limited domain (for example, perhaps only in the range 0-1).
