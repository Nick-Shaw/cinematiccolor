Color Managed Scene Referred Grading</A>

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">An original log film plate (top-left) is loaded into the color grading system. When viewed with a film emulation table (top-right), the appearance is predictive of the final output with a default exposure. If the exposure is lowered using an additive offset in log-space (lower-left), new details in the flame highlights are revealed. When a similar adjustment is applied in an output-referred space (lower-right), this detail is lost.

Going back to the overexposed example, all of the dynamic range from the original camera capture is preserved when using a scene-referred approach. Thus, when the exposure on log data changes, new details which had not previously been visible through the view transform may be revealed as no clipping has occurred. This allows color grading in log DI to be very high fidelity and most trims do not result in a flat black or flat white in the image.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">In the color managed approach, scene-referred imagery is loaded into the machine along with a viewing transform specific to the target reference display to create the final Look. The color grade manipulates the underlying scene-referred representation, but all color judgments are made previewing through the output transform. It is increasingly common to create an approved master for the main delivery format and then to use a trim pass in conjunction with each different output transform required. The trim pass can be an additional grade or metadata.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Camera raw images are the preferred choice of the colorist for the master grade. Failing that a camera-specific integer log encoding is utilized. Camera raw images are typically recognized by the main DI grading systems and facilitate the use of the correct camera transforms.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">DPX was commonly used as a log delivery format to DI and both 10 bit and 16 bit integer versions were common-place. For grainy material 10 bit is often sufficient. DPX is still used for film scans and integer sources such as a camera debayering. When passing true scene-referred linear renders directly to the DI grade, 16 bit floating-point EXR is preferable. 16 bit integer linear representations are not recommended.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">All DI grading systems process floating-point internally and can happily read EXR files, which have replaced 10 bit DPX as the preferred interchange format. However, the size of EXR and 16 bit DPX is currently costly for storage, processing, and bandwidth, so their use is far from ubiquitous, and some productions still use 10 bit DPX, even though it is less than ideal. 
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">For viewing, a suitable output transform for the target reference display is applied. The DI grading transform should match the Look Management transform. The color managed workflow should be agreed on and shared with everyone on the project, including those on set and during production to maintain consistency of the images and avoid the need to bake in the transform until the delivery stage. The scene-referred working format is an excellent archival master. The graded scene master can generate multiple deliverables and is the main asset but un ungraded version is often kept too. More information is available in the ACES Digital Source Master specification. Resolution and bit depth of all work should ideally be at least the same as that of the camera original media.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">For a simple, robust color managed workflow, ACES as described in 3.1 Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) is ideal. ACES is supported in a wide range of software applications and the standard input and output transforms are reliably consistent. ACES uses EXR files to store scene-referred data that encompasses all of the visible spectrum.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">When film was the primary theatrical deliverable, the viewing LUT used to be matched to a specific film lab and print stock, but that is rarely true now. Today theatres and broadcasters expect digital masters and the reference monitor should use the largest color encoding of all the deliverables. For the theatrical exhibition that is usually DCI P3 but for most broadcast deliveries it is still Rec. 709. VOD platforms and games devices are targeting HDR displays, which are currently limited to P3 color gamut with D65 white point, delivered as Rec. 2020. There are several flavors of HDR but they all use either PQ (Perceptual Quantiser) or Hybrid Log Gamma transfer functions. It is quite simple to convert between the two, but since PQ is by far the most common in practice, mastering to a PQ reference monitor, P3 gamut and D65 white point are recommended. All deliverables can come from that. Whatever the output transform is, it is highly recommended that the master is created by color grading the image in a scene-referred color space and making visual decisions based on the appearance after the output transform.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Standard practice is to start with the DCI theatrical master even though it will not always serve as a universal master for other deliverables. Artistic intent and the bulk of the creative decisions are inherent in the theatrical master so the DI grading project with a broader output transform can be re-used as a very efficient starting point for the universal master. Dolby Vision cinema, Eclaircolor and Samsung Onyx masters can only be color graded in a theatre on a screen of the same type as the target cinema. These deliverables are only ever created in their final viewing environment.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Artistically, the DI process can be segmented into a per-shot correction that neutralizes shot to shot color variation, and then a secondary grade that crafts the overall artistic look of the film. With those two adjustments as a base, further work is carried out to manipulate audience experience of the scene and to address any distractions or inconsistencies. As a rule colorists work on sequences, though sometimes with dynamic changes in a shot. Any work that needs to be done frame by frame is usually best done as VFX rather than DI grading. It is common for the DI facility, if an initial grade happens early enough, to communicate to the VFX houses the Looks being used. This often is sent as a CDL, or a 3D LUT, per shot and does not have the viewing transform baked into it. It is also important to communicate the color space that the color grades have been applied in as the CDL or 3D LUT will not produce the intended result without this information. Most often, the DI grading reference display is calibrated to a color space that is the same as the delivery format. 
Key Points
A color managed scene referred grade is recommended
Grades should be applied to a conform of original camera files
Multi layer EXR files are the preferred interchange format for VFX and mattes
Separate matte files can be used if the master image is unchanged
All sequences exchanged in post-production should have fixed frame handles
All sequences exchanged in post-production should retain existing metadata
