      Locking down the eventual DI viewing transform(s) early on is the critical first step in crafting cinematic color pipelines, as it pins down every other part of the process. The remainder of the pipeline essentially relies on visualizations that are created by working backwards from this step.

Digital intermediate (DI) grading is the process where the entire motion-picture is loaded into a digital device, for the purpose of color-grading in an environment that exactly mirrors the final exhibition.  Although the colorist may get involved much earlier in the project, DI grading is usually the final stage of post-production, where per-shot color grading is added and the visual look of the film is finalized and baked in. Color timing is the term used for traditional film lab color adjustments. The term Color correction is generally avoided as it implies that the original cinematography or VFX was flawed. However, correction is still used by colorists to mean continuity adjustments. The final step of baking in the Look, view transforms specific to different output devices plus any trims applied as a result of those transforms, is known as Mastering. As with so many terms encountered in this document the language is used imprecisely and often one term is substituted for another without the understanding of the finer implications. Whilst DI is generally understood to mean the color grade and mastering stage, it technically includes the entire post-production process and dates back to the 1990s when Kodak, who coined the phrase, were creating digital intermediate scenes for VFX then recording them back to film and cutting them into the intermediate negative, aka the interneg. Hence the term digital intermediate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The DI grade often follows a conform of the edit decisions, which are usually made from proxies, using original source material and scene referred final effects. The conform includes final sound and titles, though these may not be available at the beginning of the session. When time is more important than quality or when the edit decision list cannot be exported, the DI grade can be applied to an export from the edit system. This is a major compromise and not recommended.
     </p>
     <p>
      In games, the tasks and roles of the development team are not so delineated. There is rarely a specialist colorist involved and hence no DI grading session. However, games use the same or similar tools as DI grading integrated into the creation process. The nature of most games engines mandates a scene-referred workflow with a choice of output transforms to support play on any device. Consequently, Look Management is often part of the engine and far less of an issue than in the other disciplines. However there is still the concept of a mastering process, involving final quality adjustments in a review suite on one or more reference displays.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are two main approaches to handling color in the DI grade. 
Unmanaged Output Referred 
Color Managed Scene Referred
     </p>
     <p>
      The reference display must always be accurately calibrated and checked regularly. Color grade decisions should be made in real time to avoid chromatic adaptation induced errors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first approach, unmanaged, is output-referred and began in the days of telecine and hardware grading systems. A telecine is a device that transfers film to video in real time. Telecines predate video tape recorders when the only way of recording or playing back recorded images was to use film. In the early days, recorded programs were broadcast from live telecine transmissions, but as the equipment and the standards improved, programming interfaces were added so that scene by scene grading could be applied. Programmed grades were mostly recorded to video tape recorders (VTRs) so the output was always a real-time video stream. There was no need for color management since there was only ever a single playout format and the grading accuracy was wholly dependent on the monitor calibration. The calibrated telecine monitor was often referred to as the &ldquo;god monitor&rdquo; so its importance was always very clear. In the modern version of unmanaged grading, imagery is loaded into a non-linear timeline with real-time playback capability; no viewing transform is applied. The image is manipulated in the grading system, akin to a motion-picture version of Photoshop, to look correct on the calibrated reference display. The grading system and the colorist using it, treat all media, video or log, in the same way, and decisions are all output-referred. Different camera image processing, exposure, transfer functions and VFX elements are generally matched and graded by eye rather than analytically. For those used to a Color Managed workflow, it might seem strange that anyone would work this way, but for decades this was the only possible approach and the resistance to change in our industry cannot be underestimated. The output-referred method is strongly discouraged. However, it it is sometimes used if there is insufficient data about the color gamut and the transfer function of the material on the timeline. Using incorrect color science can cause distortion, artifacts and clipping. See 3.3.1 Camera profiles for more detail. Output-referred grading is also used in television and commercials where DI grading is not always the last process and there is typically a single delivery format. Scene-referred grading is considered slower, more demanding and generally more expensive in some markets and because they have less time, smaller budgets and shorter-term products they are slow to transition. When there is no color management in the final DI grading session, it is much more difficult to implement accurate Look Management. Nevertheless, preview LUTs from the colorist can be used on set and in editing or grades from the DIT or editor can be used as a reference for the DI colorist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second Color Managed approach is usually, but not always scene-referred. For the DI grade, the reference display is pivotal to the color managed transforms. The display format is defined by the delivery specification and when there are multiple deliverables the largest gamut for which there is a calibrated display is chosen. The timeline color space should be scene-referred and all sources mapped to it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sometimes the output color space is used as the working color space and transforms are only applied to the sources. With this approach grading is output-referred, and there is no real benefit to it, so it is not discussed further in this paper.
