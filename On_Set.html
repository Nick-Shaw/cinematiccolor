<BIG CLASS="LARGE">During filming, the aim is to capture the greatest amount of information possible, at the highest quality possible in order to give maximum flexibility in post-production, and to facilitate the integration of VFX elements. From a camera perspective, this means shooting in a raw format or log encoding and exposing to ensure that as much as possible of the dynamic range of the scene is captured. The way modern digital cameras apply the Exposure Index (EI) set while shooting is to alter the sensor level which maps to mid-grey, and in doing so a trade-off is created between the amount of latitude available above and below grey. The total dynamic range of a sensor is fixed. Rating a camera at a lower EI will mean lighting the scene more brightly for the same exposure, resulting in lower noise, which is beneficial for VFX. However, because doing this also reduces highlight latitude, care should be taken that important highlight detail is not clipped. In a studio, where the lighting can be controlled, this is not normally an issue, but on location, it is important to be aware of this limitation.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The monitoring output from the camera is the first opportunity for the production to get a preview of the intended look of the motion picture. When a look has been designed during pre-production, this can be applied to the signal sent to on-set monitors, complementing that part of the aesthetic of the film which comes from production design and costume. The look of a film can easily become ingrained in peopleâ€™s minds based on how they first see it, so taking the opportunity to present the image in at least an approximation of its intended form at the earliest possible stage can be very beneficial. However, care should be taken if using extreme looks that the appearance of the image transformed through them does not negatively impact exposure decisions. It is advisable to also check the image through a standard neutral display transform, to ensure that a well exposed image is being recorded, clear of both the sensor noise floor and highlight clipping, and to allow for the possibility of different decisions about the look being made in DI grading.
