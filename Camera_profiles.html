Camera profiles</A>

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Color management should be used at every stage of the pipeline, and for material acquired with a digital camera, this can begin on set. All current digital cinema cameras capture a wide dynamic range and color gamut, and their encoding primaries and transfer functions are published by the manufacturers. Whether the recording is being made in a raw or camera log format, a log signal is usually available from a monitoring output of the camera. These are high-dynamic range, scene-referred representations of the image and can be used to apply a viewing transform, with or without a look included, which can be replicated and refined as the image passes through the various stages of post-production.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">As can be seen from the above plots of some common camera log curves, the basic shape of all the curves is quite similar, with each having a straight line for a large part of the curve with a toe where it is compressed towards black. The value for lens cap black is often based on the 10 bit Cineon code value of 95 for Dmin. The straight line segment, in a plot with a logarithmic x-axis such as this, shows that the encoding is truly logarithmic in that part of the range, with an equal number of code values per stop. Its slope varies between encodings, as does the exposure represented by a log value of 1.0. It is therefore important to know what the encoding curve used for a given log image is, in order to be able to linearize it correctly. A LUT or ACES Input Transform designed for one camera may give a superficially pleasing result with an image from a different camera  but could cause unwanted clipping or distortion which is not obvious on all images. Using an incorrect LUT or Input Transform for aesthetic purposes is a risky strategy, which can cause problems further down the line. It is strongly recommended to use a correct linearization, and a separate operation for the look. It is important to understand that although a camera may use an encoding curve which has a particular dynamic range, this should not be taken to suggest that the camera itself can capture that range. The Sony FS7 for example, at default EI, clips six stops above mid-grey which maps to an S-Log3 value of 0.866. Values above this will not occur, even though S-Log3 can encode 7.74 stops above grey. Details of the encoding and decoding equations for various log curves is given in Appendix 4.1.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The cameral log encoding of the ‘A’ Camera on a production is often chosen as the working format for the final DI, since log encodings lend themselves well to the kinds of adjustments made during grading. They are constrained to the 0-1 range, or integer encoding of that range, and map the dynamic range of the scene evenly across the code values. Images from other types of camera can be transformed into the ‘A’ Camera’s log encoding. Alternatively, all cameras can be transformed into a non-camera-specific log working space such as ACEScct for grading. Ideally, this choice should be made in advance in consultation with the DI colorist, so any grading adjustments use the same working space.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Plots of the primaries of some common camera encodings
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The above diagrams show the encoding primaries used by various digital cinema cameras, as well as those of ACES2065-1 and ACEScg. As can be seen, the CIE xy coordinates of the primaries vary considerably, so it is clear that a transform or LUT designed for one, will not work as intended on another. It is important also to be aware that these are simply encoding primaries, to which the raw sensor output of a camera is transformed. While they define the gamut of the encoding color space, this does not mean that the camera system in question can ‘see’ every color within that gamut. Indeed, since some primaries have negative coordinates, the encoding can represent colors which have no meaning in CIExy encoding. Despite this, a camera may produce pixels which appear to have these colors, particularly when lights with discontinuous spectra are visible in the frame. This is due to the residual error in the matrices chosen by the manufacturer to transform from the sensor’s raw RGB to the encoding color space. Cameras are not truly colorimetric, and so no 3×3 matrix can produce a perfect result. Manufacturers choose a matrix which minimizes errors in important colors such as skin tones. Care must be taken with images which contain these unreal colors, as the negative pixel values they contain may cause unwanted artifacts.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">A more accurate matrix could be derived specific to the precise shooting setup, lighting, lenses, and filtration, but unless it is vital to have as photometrically accurate a result as possible, it is normally preferable to use the manufacturer provided matrix, such as those in the published ACES Input Transforms, to ensure matching processing by all vendors handling the media.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The images above show how footage from different cameras can be matched by bringing them into a common working space and then applying the same display transform. The camera log images have been normalized by applying gain in scene-referred linear to bring the white chip of the chart to RGB = [0.9, 0.9, 0.9]. The difference between the log encoding curves is apparent as the differences in percieved contrast between the various log images, even though they encode the same scene luminance. The difference in the location of the encoding primaries manifests as variation in the apparent saturation of the log images, noticeable particularly in the green part of the chart from the RED camera. These differences in the way the same scene colorimetry is encoded are removed by using the appropriate Input Transform to convert to the ACES2065-1 colour space. The display transform is then applied by adding a half stop push for aesthetic reasons, and then using the ACES Rec. 709 Output Transform. It can be seen that even with the manufacturers’ published Input Transforms, there is still variation, particularly in the rendering of skin tones. The difference in the spectral responses of the different sensors (in fact primarily the differences between the spectral characteristics of the Bayer color filters on the sensors as well as the IR filtration) and the fact that some artistic choice is involved in characterizing a sensor, mean that each camera has slightly different feel to its image; this is unrelated to the differences between the appearance of the log encodings. ACES Input Transforms will not make all cameras look identical, but should provide a reasonable match up within the limits of each camera.

Key Points
Cameras from different manufacturers use different log encoding curves and primaries to represent the same scene colorimetry
These are just encoding methods, and if properly interpreted have no impact on the final look of the image
Cameras still have varying characteristics which do affect the look of the image
ACES Input Transforms bring different sources into a common working space so that the same Output Transform can be used for all sources, giving a close match of appearance
