Establishing the Look</A>
</H2>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Design influences in pre-production begin with the producers and director discussing ideas. The Look begins with these ideas and concepts, sometimes collected in the form of a design scrapbook. In live-action, the Directory of Photography (DP), costume and set designers, makeup, the post-production supervisor, concept artists, and others then work together to develop an early version of the Look, which is then built into a look transform as a LUT, ASC Color Decision List (CDL) or other similar proprietary formats. These early discussions drive the selection of cameras, lighting, stages, locations, costumes and image processing. Sometimes extensive camera and DI grading tests are made to confirm viability or assist in the decision-making process, but usually, ideas remain relatively fluid in the early period. The director's scrapbook often helps to communicate the influences as well as the intent.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">If the Look evolves progressively from an established concept, through Look Management, and into the DI grade it results in higher quality deliverables and can also save a great deal of time, effort and money. Even with the most careful Look Management, there are likely to be many modifications in the final stage, the DI grade. More of this is discussed later in the 3.6 DI Grading. Sometimes the colorist may be asked to dramatically diverge from the original artistic intent, and this may be for any number of reasons.

Once source images exist it is up to Look Management to enable all the contributors to view the images as intended, then for DI grading to perfect the Look on a scene by scene basis and to manage elements within each frame if necessary. The DI colorist is also responsible for managing any differences that occur as a result of different color gamut, dynamic range or resolution in the final delivery versions. There are two schools of thought on this. Some studios prefer that all versions are as similar as possible and are prepared to surrender the extremes of gamut and dynamic range to ensure that. Others seek to exploit the full use of high-dynamic range and wide color gamuts even though the differences between delivery versions are more apparent.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Crafting the Look in the widest color space, highest dynamic range and highest resolution provides a more future proof master deliverable, especially if the project remains scene-referred. Some organisations use this as a marketing differentiator. Lighting, makeup and production design decisions for an HDR screen master are very different to those made for an SDR television master, so it is best to consider the primary target display technology as early as possible.

In some productions, particularly in animation, the Look is set in early pre-production, with a little latitude for DI grading allowed to help continuity and atmosphere. There are situations when the Look may be quite different for some deliverables, e.g. for HDR Displays, or the Look may evolve over time, for example, TV series can look different between early seasons. These may need to be better matched for box sets later on. Often, the Look is not fully defined until the DI grading stage and then the extra flexibility of source referred VFX elements is advantageous. The Look can change even if the final DI colorist is involved from the very start either on-set or for the dailies. Changes to contrast, color or brightness might behave differently on CG material compared to camera sourced media. Whilst it is the intent in an ideal world that CG elements exactly match the scene-referred pixel values that the live-action camera would have captured, in reality, the capture process itself may have variations. Then the colorist has to correct for continuity as well as apply the Look. Differences between elements are also likely to occur if the Look Management is not applied correctly across all departments and facilities.

The responsibility of approving the Look can fall to the producer, director, cinematographer, colorist, VFX supervisor. Sometimes even the editor is involved. Often there are disagreements on the Look and the way it is interpreted scene-to-scene. For that reason, it helps to clarify whose vision the post-production team are working towards. Without clear direction, much time will be lost preparing alternate versions or re-rendering fixes in the final DI grade as decisions change. Whoever makes the decisions on the Look, someone then has to take responsibility for it through to delivery. That is usually either the Director of Photography or the colorist. The senior colorist is likely to be more accessible but may not be appointed until much later in the post-production timetable. Whilst there is a strong tendency for everyone to become familiar and comfortable with the Look set in the color managed pipeline it can happen that quite significant changes are made at the final grading stages in order to better communicate an impression to the audience.  Often the full resolution images are not seen on a large calibrated display in the edited sequence until the DI master grade when there is no longer an obligation to use reversible transforms. The DI colorist  can then finesse each scene to work within the Look or tweak the Look to better convey the artistic intent.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The Look for animation is guided by artwork created in visual development. Translating the creative style into a Look that can be applied to CG animation is an iterative process utilizing render tests of neutrally lit character rigs as well as more complete scenes that are representative of the storytelling environment. In a facility where there is a history of previous Looks, one of these may be selected as a starting point for further development. It can also help to start with a relatively neutral look before incorporating specific creative touches. A neutral look is useful for verifying the technical quality of renders and the accuracy of physical simulations.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The initial pass at the Look tries to establish the desired contrast and overall shape of the tone curve along with the appropriate level of color saturation. Once this is established more specific adjustments can be made to dial in characteristics such as the behavior of bright highlights and shadow detail. A controlled amount of color distortion may be desirable sometimes, for example, to lend warmth to highlights. These fine adjustments may not be easy to make with a general test image, but can be made more obvious by selecting the right image content. Characters are particularly useful for fine-tuning the appearance of facial contours, highlights in the hair and the overall reproduction of skin tones, while environments are useful for evaluating color relationships and setting the behavior of very bright light sources. Because the final viewed color is a product of both the rendered or captured image and the Look it is viewed through, it is important to set the Look early so that changes do not impact approved images once production is underway. Once a base Look has been set for the movie, it may also be complemented by secondary Looks to support the story as it shifts into different environments.

The Look for a games project is established in much the same way as for an animated feature. Tests using environments and characters are run to establish the desired contrast, saturation and overall shape of any S-curve that may be required (if any). In the context of a game, a Look has to serve not just the vision of the art director but also the goals of the gameplay designers. If a Look is overly contrasty, it may interfere with gameplay by making enemies hiding in shadows effectively invisible to the player. By the same token, if the tone curve’s shoulder is too abrupt, the detail in the highlights may be lost, which can hinder gameplay if bright objects or enemies can’t be differentiated from bright skies or lights. Content is often validated against the game Look as well as a neutral Look. Since games are real-time and often built as a result of rapid iteration, the ability to change is held in high regard and thus content may be reused in multiple very different Looks. For example, gameplay may require a different Look for low health, or the game may be played at different times of day. Thus validating the content holds up in both the target Look and a neutral Look gives confidence the lighting or Look can be changed without requiring significant asset rework. Checking content in a neutral and project-specific Look mirrors animation and live-action workflows.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Games can be made with fairly small teams and as such, one person may perform many separate roles. There is generally no one person who tends to own Look creation, though the art director will typically drive it and make the final call to sign off on assets, lighting and Look adjustments made by a team of artists. One difference with live-action and animation is that because game engines generate new images every time the game is played, the opportunity to change and refine the Look extends even closer to the time when the audience sees the finished frames even tuning it to suit the individual display being used. By association, they have less ability to fall back to manually created and fine-tuned trim passes like visual effects and animation projects to optimize the display quality for different displays’ dynamic range and gamut. Although broad operating parameters can be set for the engine to work within and interpolate accordingly. Efforts such as the “HDR Gaming Interest Group” (HGIG) aim to optimize the images generated to best utilize the characteristics of each display.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Key Points
Even without making a choice, each project has its Look.
The Look influences audience perception of imagery.
The earlier the Look is established the more effective it is implemented.
Testing with a neutral look is useful for verifying technical quality and accuracy
The base Look may be complemented by secondary looks for some scenes
