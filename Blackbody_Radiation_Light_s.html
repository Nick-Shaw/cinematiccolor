Blackbody Radiation, Light sources and Illuminants</A>
</H2>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">All ordinary matter emits electromagnetic radiation when its temperature is above absolute zero. Even black holes are predicted to emit Hawking radiation, a form of blackbody radiation caused by the creation of sub-atomic particles near the event horizon.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">A blackbody or Planckian radiator is an ideal thermal radiator that absorbs all incident radiation, disregarding the wavelength, the direction of incidence or the polarization completely. In thermal equilibrium, it emits electromagnetic radiation (blackbody radiation) with a characteristic spectral distribution that depends only on its temperature and is given by Planck's Law.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">When their temperature increases past 750 Kelvin, blackbodies start to emit visible electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Various blackbody spectral power distributions in temperature domain 1250-10000K, note how their radiation peak slides into the visible spectrum range as their temperature increase.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Blackbodies are fundamental to both astronomy and color science allowing one to determine the color of a thermal radiator knowing only its temperature. Conversely, its temperature can be computed from its color.
In 1931, using Planck's Law, the CIE was able to unambiguously and mathematically describe a standard tungsten light source: the CIE Standard Illuminant A with a color temperature of 2856K.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">ASTM G-173 ETR Extraterrestrial Radiation (solar spectrum at top of atmosphere) at mean Earth-Sun distance compared to a Blackbody at 5778K. The differences between the curves are mostly explained by the fact that the Sun is not a perfect blackbody.
The Sun, principal light source on Earth with an effective surface temperature of 5,778K, is close to an ideal thermal radiator. Its spectrum exhibits numerous absorption and emission spectral lines, i.e. the Fraunhofer lines, resulting from the interactions of atoms, atom nuclei, and molecules with photons in its atmosphere. The Sun is not a solid body and has multiple layers with different temperatures: corona, chromosphere, photosphere, convective zone, radiative zone, and core. The photosphere, the layer of gas constituting the visible surface of the Sun, is the principal source of the radiation we receive and the region where most of the aforementioned spectral lines are forming. When solar radiation traverses the Earth atmosphere, it interacts with it, producing absorption, emission and scattering events that further modify its spectrum.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Profile image of the daylight spectrum captured with a DIY spectroscope and a CANON 5D Mark II DSLR camera. Major Fraunhofer Lines are annotated for reference. The black curve represents the luminance of the spectrum at each wavelength. The white curve is a reference spectrum concurrently captured with an Ocean Optics STS-VIS spectrometer. While the spectroscope has a very high resolution, the overall curve shape is dramatically different to that of the spectrometer one: the DSLR spectral sensitivities, its infrared filter, and reflections in the spectroscope tube are all contributing to alter the curve, making it unsuitable for precise measurements.
CIE Illuminants B and C were intended to respectively model noon sunlight (correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4874K) and average daylight (CCT of 6774K). They are realised by combining a light source modeling CIE Standard Illuminant A with Davis-Gibson liquid filters from David and Gibson (1931). Because of the low illuminance levels achieved with such light sources and their poor performance in the near-ultraviolet region (which is essential for fluorescent materials), they were deprecated in favor of the CIE Illuminant D Series created by Judd, MacAdam, and Wyszecki (1964).
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The CIE Illuminant D Series models a broad range of daylight phases inclusive of direct sunlight, sunlight with cloud coverage, full overcast coverage, and blue skylight. For standardization purposes, "CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65 should be used in all colorimetric calculations requiring representative daylight unless there are specific reasons for using a different illuminant" (ISO 11664-2:2007(E)/CIES014-2/E:2006).
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">CIE Illuminants B, C, and CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65. Note how the CIE Illuminants B and C curves are different to the CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65 curve in the 300nm-380nm near-ultraviolet region.
From a terminology standpoint, it is meaningful to understand that illuminants and light sources are different:
An illuminant is a standardized table of values or mathematical function representing an ideal light source.
A light source is a physical emitter of visible radiant energy.
