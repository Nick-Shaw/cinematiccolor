Chromatic Adaptation</A>
</H3>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The CIE defines chromatic adaptation as the "visual process whereby approximate compensation is made for changes in the colo(u)rs of stimuli, especially in the case of changes in illuminants".
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Chromatic adaptation controls the independent sensitivity of the three cones cells type and is the most important adaptation mechanism in color appearance. A white object viewed under different lighting conditions (daylight, tungsten or incandescent lighting) retains its white appearance because the sensitivity of the cone cells is independently adjusted to compensate for the changes in energy level at the wavelength ranges they are sensitive to. Chromatic adaptation can be thought of as analogous to the automatic white balancing feature of a camera.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">It is important to make a distinction between the adapted white, defined by the CIE as the "colour stimulus that an observer who is adapted to the viewing environment would judge to be perfectly achromatic and to have a luminance factor of unity" and the adopted white defined as the "spectral radiance distribution as seen by an image capture or measurement device and converted to colour signals that are considered to be perfectly achromatic and to have an observer adaptive luminance factor of unity; i.e., colour signals that are considered to correspond to a perfect white diffuser". The adopted white, used in the color imaging system, is specified and known while the adapted white of the HVS can only be estimated.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Chromatic adaptation occurs at a faster rate than dark and light adaptation. Rinner and Gegenfurtner (2000) measured two separate adaptation mechanisms representing 40
Through a series of experiments that measured the spatial, temporal, and chromatic properties of chromatic-adaptation mechanisms, Fairchild (1993) has shown clear evidence that along the well known sensory mechanisms supporting an automatic response to a stimulus, e.g. retinal gain control, there were also cognitive mechanisms dependent on the observer knowledge of the scene content.
The cognitive mechanisms are very effective when viewing hard-copy images, e.g. print of a photograph: they allow the observer to discount the scene illuminant, but they do not work with soft-copy displays, e.g. a monitor displaying the photograph, as those cannot be interpreted as illuminated objects and thus only sensory mechanisms are active.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Key Points
Lack of illumination triggers dark adaptation, rod cells sensitivity increases and outperforms that of the cones; full adaptation occurs within 30 minutes.
Light adaptation happens when entering a bright area, rod cells saturate while cone cells are adapting;  full adaptation occurs within 5-10 minutes.
Chromatic adaptation controls the independent sensitivity of the cone cells, causing objects to retain their appearance under different illumination conditions; chromatic adaptation is fast: it happens in the course of a few milliseconds and reaches completion within 2 minutes.
Chromatic adaptation is commonly compared to the white-balancing feature of a camera.
