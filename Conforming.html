<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The dated video-centric approach to grading comes from the time when colorists worked on a reel of film or a tape. Film and tape sources playback as a fixed linear timeline and were usually graded out of context. Media was passed from color grading back to editorial for mastering. That workflow is still used especially for commercial work, although the tape source has now been replaced by a random access digital file. The file is broken down into shots or events either by loading an edit decision list (EDL) or by scene detecting the program. The workflow is not ideal for VFX inserts but in this scenario completed VFX files are added by the editor, prior to the color grade. Titles are added after the color grade. VFX are usually submitted as output-referred files that match the delivery format reference display. This allows very little manipulation in grading and can suffer a quality loss since the pipeline is not scientifically color managed. A more flexible alternative is to discuss the process with the editor and deliver VFX log encoded, preserving more dynamic range and having more latitude in the grade. Since the final look is unknown until after the DI grade, the VFX log image, just like camera media benefits from this extended dynamic range.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">In the recommended workflow, the DI colorist receives the edit decision list, the original source material, VFX that match the source material and the final soundtracks, and then conforms them as a multi-track non-linear timeline in the grading system. The conform might be done by the colorist, an assistant or by an editor dedicated to the task. The colorist then matches the scenes, manages the look and applies shot to shot or frame to frame fixes as necessary. The best results are obtained from a scene-referred workflow that uses color managed transforms at each stage. This brings different sources closer together before the grading begins, but more importantly, it makes it much easier to deliver alternate formats using output transforms, which are more accurate and less work than using just trims. It also permits VFX, editorial and other departments to see representative images on displays calibrated to different standards, at any stage of the process.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The edit decision list could be as simple as one or more EDL files, one per track, but is usually an XML or AAF that supports multiple tracks. A reference movie of the cut should be provided to check for errors in conform. These are particularly likely to occur when size and speed changes are included in the edit decision list. This list is crucial in selecting shots for VFX and determining the exact frames required. VFX should be returned with frame handles of a consistent length which simplifies conforming if there are updates. The number of frames in the handles should be agreed and specified early in the production. Mattes generated at the time the VFX are rendered are best combined as an alpha channel or multi layer EXR. Mattes created later in post production for use in DI grading can be delivered as separate files. Most DI grading systems can parse separate mattes from the RGB and alpha channels of an image file. The mattes need to be synchronized with the effect shot so it is always recommended that the matte and the image files have identical timecode or frame count. Usually, the effect shot and the matte are trimmed to the required frames, with handles if specified, and have the same duration. The file names should be identical except for a suffix for the mattes. Mattes and images are, however, usually placed in separate folders to simplify the conform process. Clearly, if two files with similar filenames and identical timecode exist in the same folder there is a good chance that the matte and the image will get confused during an auto conform.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">In the modern DI workflow, the first conform happens before picture lock, which allows the colorist to export precise frame sequences for VFX. The coloristâ€™s first pass focuses on neutralization, matching the adjacent shots in the cut at the time. The colorist may have already started work on the Look and more detailed select parts of the frame, but these should not be present in the export. The ideal export format is EXR, as it can preserve all the available source data. In current practice, VFX facilities prefer to have exported frames in the original camera format along with CDLs that encode the first pass neutralization. This reduces the likelihood of issues that crop up when images have been processed by different packages that may have differing implementations of transforms that should match. Input Transforms are currently a prominent source of variation between software packages. When returning finished VFX for integration into the DI conform master it is important to have a clear policy on handles, color gamut, white point, file naming and format. VFX may come from a variety of facilities around the world, so if each team use a different process they are unlikely to integrate well. Generally, VFX shots returned to the DI conform should retain the naming convention and timecode of the supplied plates with a suffix appended for versions and dates. Technically EXR is again the preferred format, but productions may choose DPX or a Quicktime or MXF wrapper for practical reasons.
