<BIG CLASS="LARGE">DI grading is done in a viewing environment that exactly mirrors the final primary exhibition. Digital intermediate (and mastering) typically have very tight tolerances on calibration, as the decisions made in this process are the last time image color appearance is tweaked.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">An issue in some feature production is that the typical artist display does not match the eventual theatrical viewing specification or environment; some audiences will see more color detail than the original artist. Workstations commonly use sRGB or Rec. 709 displays, which represent the smallest color space and lowest dynamic range used in distribution. Workstation displays are often not even calibrated beyond an eyeball check. Theatrical releases use the slightly wider P3 color space and there is a fast-growing home market for HDR content, which also uses a P3 limited color space but has considerably more dynamic range than traditional displays. Streaming companies like Netflix are increasingly producing original content in HDR.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Histograms are a useful tool when analyzing image fidelity, and often help forensically track down if post-processing has been applied to an image. For example, log frames from certain motion-picture cameras often do not make full use of the integer coding space. This can be detected in the histogram and is helpful in tracking down an image color space when the original is unknown. The application of sharpening filters, detectable from their residual undershoot and overshoot, can also be observed in the histograms. It is possible to detect if image quantization has occurred, appearing as tell-tale “comb-like” peaks and valleys in the histogram. Leveraging histograms computed on HSV-transformed imagery as a final quality-check has been proven to be an invaluable tool.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">There are other image artifacts, such as aliasing, that are best inspected on moving imagery. For example, the use of interpolation kernels, such as nearest-neighbor or bilinear, are often unobjectionable on still imagery yet artifact-inducing on slowly animating transforms, particularly near horizontal lines. Always be on the lookout for moire patterns and other high-frequency artifacts, particularly when such filters have been applied to imagery with fine details, such as cloth, or wave patterns. If all digital imagery were ideally sampled, this would not be an issue. However, camera manufacturers have a tendency to bias imagery to be overly-sharp and motion transformations accentuate such artifacts. Over sharpening is less common with high-end digital cinema cameras.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">For stereo deliveries, it’s critical to quality check both eyes individually, as well as together in a proper stereo viewing environment. There are many stereo artifacts which are only visible on true 3D displays, and catching these early on is most cost-effective.
