          <p class="noindent">Color science is the scientific
          domain studying the human perception of color, its
          measurement, and characterization. Terminology in a
          scientific field is critical to understanding that field
          and precisely discussing its concepts. Color is
          ubiquitous in our lives but typically not well
          understood.</p>
          <p class="indent">Mark D. Fairchild writes: “Almost
          everyone knows what color is. After all, they have had
          firsthand experience of it since shortly after birth.
          However, very few can precisely describe their color
          experiences or even precisely define color.”</p>
          <p class="indent">The International Commission on
          Illumination (CIE) defines perceived color as the
          “characteristic of visual perception that can be
          described by attributes of hue, brightness (or lightness)
          and colo(u)rfulness (or saturation or chroma).”</p>
          <p class="indent">This document is necessarily an
          overview of color science. The foundational texts listed
          below can provide a deeper understanding. Digital Color
          Management: Encoding Solutions, 2nd Edition by Madden and
          Giorgianni (2007) provides an in-depth analysis of the
          nature of color images, digital color encoding, color
          management systems and digital color interchange. Color
          Appearance Models by Fairchild (2013) is the reference
          for the fundamental concepts and phenomena of color
          appearance. The Reproduction of Colour (6th ed.) by Hunt
          (2004) describes the fundamental principles of
          colorimetry, color appearance, color reproduction for
          photography, television, printing and electronic imaging.
          Digital Video and HD, Second Edition: Algorithms and
          Interfaces by Poynton (2012) details the theory and
          engineering of digital video systems. Color Science:
          Concepts and Methods, Quantitative Data and Formulae by
          Wyszecki and Stiles (1982) is the authoritative reference
          for colorimetry. The authors of this paper are greatly
          indebted to the writers of these books.</p>
          <p class="indent">Dr. Robert W.G. Hunt passed away during
          the writing of this section. His work is foundational to
          the color science community. Dr. Hunt’s contributions to
          the understanding of human color perception and its
          application to the engineering of photographic systems
          laid the foundation for much of the color science that is
          used in the motion picture and gaming industries today.
          Besides being a brilliant scientist, Dr. Hunt was a kind
          man always willing to share his knowledge, whether
          formally in one of the many classes he taught, or
          informally over coffee or a meal. Dr. Hunt’s true passion
          was teaching others. A few of the authors of this
          document had the good fortune to have known and learned
          from Dr. Hunt and were saddened to hear of his passing.
          His contributions to the field, friendship and mentorship
          will be missed.</p>
          <p class="indent">A tribute to Dr. Robert W.G. Hunt:
          Light dispersion through a prism (bottom right) with the
          rainbow of color components lighting up The Reproduction
          of Colour (6th ed.) by Hunt (2004).</p>
          <p class="indent">Color management depends fundamentally
          on colorimetry, the measurement of color. Without
          colorimetry, it is not possible to characterize cameras
          and displays or understand the imaging principles that
          permeate the rest of computer graphics. While it is
          possible to immediately dive into color pipelines, having
          a rudimentary understanding of concepts such as spectral
          measurement, tristimulus values, or color appearance
          provides a richer understanding of why some approaches to
          color management are successful, and some are not.</p>
          <p class="indent">This section endeavors to stay generic
          and abstract. It does not focus on particular workflow
          details but provides the necessary foundations for
          understanding section 3. This section abundantly
          references the history of color science because the
          understanding of the past is essential for the
          comprehension of the present: knowing how colorimetry
          evolved explains the current practices. The physical
          nature of light and the quantities used for its analysis
          are examined. The anatomy of the human visual system
          (HVS) is reviewed with a particular focus on the eye and
          the primary adaptation mechanisms. Basic colorimetry is
          presented, providing the requisites for converting
          spectral measurements to RGB values or understanding
          perceptual uniformity. Advanced colorimetry, the gateway
          to color appearance modeling, is summarily exposed. Then,
          the representation of color is described, driving the
          section toward concrete concepts in direct relation with
          motion pictures color management. Finally, color imaging
          systems and the image capture, signal processing, and
          image formation stages are explained using digital
          imaging devices such as motion pictures cameras or LCD
          displays.</p>
          <p class="indent">Key Points Color science studies the
          human perception of color, its measurement, and
          characterization. Proper terminology usage is critical to
          the understanding of a scientific field. Color is the
          characteristic of a visual perception. Color management
          depends on colorimetry, the measurement of color.</p>
