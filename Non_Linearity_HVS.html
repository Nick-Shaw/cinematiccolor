</BIG>

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The just-noticeable difference (JND) is the minimum change in stimulus intensity required to produce a detectable variation in sensory experience. Weber's law states that the JND between two stimuli is proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli: an increment is judged relative to the previous amount.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">In Elements of psychophysics, Fechner (1860) mathematically characterized Weber’s law showing that it follows a logarithmic transformation: the subjective sensation of a stimulus is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. Fechner’s scaling has been found to apply to the perception of brightness, at moderate and high brightness, with perceived brightness being proportional to the logarithm of the actual intensity. 
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">At lower levels of brightness, the De Vries-Rose law applies which states that the perception of brightness is proportional to the square root of the actual intensity. 
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Stevens generalises Fechner's law: the results of the physical-perceptual relationship of his experiments on a logarithmic scale were characterized by straight lines with different slopes, suggesting that the relationship between perceptual magnitude and stimulus intensity follows a power law with varying exponent.

</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Because of the various HVS adaptation mechanisms, perceived brightness has a non-linear relationship with the actual physical intensity of the stimulus. A cube root commonly approximates it. Multiple models of lightness were proposed leading to the creation of CIE L* in 1976. CIE L* characterizes the perceptual response to relative luminance.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">CIE L* characterizes the perceptual response to relative luminance.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">CIE L* was developed for colorimetric measurements of colored samples under a uniform illumination source. It was not tested for high illumination conditions with color stimuli orders of magnitude below or above a perfect white diffuse reflector. The resulting uncertainty in Lightness prediction for High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging applications leads scientific research into searching for a better function. Fairchild and Wyble (2010) and Fairchild and Chen (2011) proposed a new physiologically-plausible hyperbolic function based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, a model of enzyme kinetics. Abebe, Pouli, Larabi, and Reinhard (2017) modified Fairchild and Chen (2011) function to account for emissive color stimuli. As the writing of this document, the CIE has not yet adopted a new suitable function.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">With the related objective of finding a function adapted to HDR image formation, Miller (2014) designed the Perceptual Quantizer (PQ). It is an important function, standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers as SMPTE ST 2084 and this document frequently refers to it.
